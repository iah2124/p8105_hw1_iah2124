## Homework 1

## Problem 0.2

Loading the penguin datasets
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Problem 1
Loading tidyverse package - includes dplyr for data manipulation
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Size of the dataset
```{r}
num_rows = nrow(penguins)
num_cols = ncol(penguins)
```

Finding the mean flipper length from the penguins dataset, excluding any missing values
```{r}
mean_flipper_length = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

This dataset contains information about penguins including identifying #, which species island they are from, bill length(mm), bill depth(mm), flipper length(mm), body mass(g), sex, and year. There are 344 observations in the dataset, with 8 variables. The mean flipper length is 200.92mm.
